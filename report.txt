Tailwind CSS – What It Is and Why I Use It

Tailwind CSS is a utility-based CSS framework. It helps me style elements directly in HTML using short class names like p-4, text-center, or bg-blue-600. 
I don’t have to write separate CSS for most things. This saves time and makes everything more consistent.

Why Tailwind CSS Is Important

Fast development – I can build UIs quickly without writing custom CSS. Easy to make responsive, Tailwind has built-in classes like sm:, md:, and lg: for different screen sizes. 
Consistent design – It uses a design system with fixed values for spacing, fonts, colors, etc. No naming issues – I don’t have to worry about class names like .card-box or .page-title. 
Smaller file size – Tailwind’s JIT compiler only includes the CSS I actually use.

Some Common Classes I Use

Layout
flex, grid: For layout.
items-center, justify-center: For aligning items.
gap-4: For spacing between items.

Spacing
m-4, mt-2, mx-auto: Margin.
p-4, pt-6, px-8: Padding.

Text
text-sm, text-xl: Font size.
font-bold, font-light: Font weight.
text-gray-700, text-blue-500: Text colors.
text-center, text-left: Text alignment.

Background and Borders
bg-gray-100, bg-red-500: Background colors.
border, rounded, shadow: For borders, round corners, and shadows.

Responsive
sm:, md:, lg:: For mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

Using Arbitrary Values
Sometimes I need custom values that aren’t in the default Tailwind setup. For that, I use arbitrary values with square brackets [].

Examples

<div class="w-[320px] h-[150px] text-[20px] bg-[#1abc9c] rounded-[12px]">
  Custom size and styles
</div>

w-[320px]: Exact width.
text-[20px]: Exact font size.
bg-[#1abc9c]: Custom color.
rounded-[12px]: Custom border radius.

Arbitrary values give me more control without changing the config file.

Conclusion
Tailwind CSS helps me build websites faster and cleaner. I don’t need to write a lot of CSS, and I can handle layout, spacing, text, and responsiveness directly in HTML.
It also keeps everything looking uniform. When I need something extra, I just use arbitrary values.
